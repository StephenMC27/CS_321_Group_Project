CS 321 Group Project: Twitter Bot

Team: Stephen Clark (Team Leader), Josh Harrington, Jake Zegeer

For GMU's CS 321 - Software Engineering course, we are creating a Twitter bot. Each morning, this bot will tweet out information to help users start their day off on the right foot. The tweet will include the local weather information for Fairfax, VA, a new song recommendation, an inspirational quote, and an awe-inspiring photograph.
